"69","@akwatik92: But then it was obvious that something was wrong, right? The thing about strokes is that a lot of people won't recognize the symptoms because they don't seem that threatening at first - and by the time they realize this could be something serious, it might be too late for the best therapy (thrombolysis). This is why FAST was created, to create awareness of the fact that these isolated symptoms can be signs of a stroke and to emphasize on the importance of fast reaction.","zoidberg85","0","0","2010-08-22T14:36:34.000Z","Ugznf3b7pNKFPjvOc-94AaABAg","None","FALSE","YHzz2cXBlGk"
